          <h2>4. Legal Basis and Authorized Use</h2>
          <p>
            The App is for authorized MTJ Foundation personnel only. You must use donor
            and personal data solely for legitimate MTJ Foundation fundraising,

        <section>
          <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
          <p>We may share information only as needed to operate the DMS:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service providers:</strong> Hosting, database, email, or infrastructure
              providers that process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment partners:</strong> Where online donations are processed outside
              DMS (e.g. payment gateways on public donation channels), those providers
              receive payment-related data under their own privacy terms
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or valid

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Primary data is stored on secure servers using PostgreSQL and access-controlled APIs</li>
            <li>Passwords are not stored in plain text; industry-standard authentication practices apply</li>
            <li>Access is limited by user roles and permissions within the organization</li>
            <li>
              Local device storage (e.g. browser IndexedDB) may temporarily hold offline
              entries until they are synced; protect your device and do not share login credentials
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Report suspected
            unauthorized access to {CONTACT_EMAIL} immediately.

          <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>

            We retain donor, donation, and operational records for as long as needed for
            fundraising operations, legal obligations, auditing, and historical reporting.
            Account logs may be retained for security and troubleshooting for a limited period.
